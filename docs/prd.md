# Art Department UI Component Revamp PRD

## Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines a focused UI component revamp for the existing Art Department WordPress Plugin. The project will modernize the user interface with improved React components while maintaining the existing PHP backend and file-based data structure. This approach delivers immediate UX improvements without the complexity of full system migration.

**Project Overview:**
- **Current State**: jQuery-based plugin with collapsible image categories and selection system
- **Target State**: Modern React UI components with same PHP backend and file structure
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for UI revamp delivery
- **Budget**: $8,000 - $12,000
- **Key Constraint**: No test site environment - all development must be local with mock data

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### 1.1 Current System Analysis

#### Existing Architecture
The current Art Department Plugin (version 1.5) uses a simple but effective WordPress plugin architecture:

**Frontend Structure:**
- jQuery-based JavaScript for basic interactions
- HTML forms with minimal validation
- File-based image organization in category folders
- Collapsible category sections with image grids
- Quantity selectors with +/- buttons
- Floating "Selected Items" box with sticky positioning

**Backend Structure:**
- Single PHP file (`art-department-book.php`) with procedural functions
- AJAX form handling via `admin-ajax.php`
- File system image storage (`/wp-content/uploads/art-department/`)
- Email notifications through `wp_mail()`
- Template includes for modular HTML structure

**Key Components:**
- **Image Grid**: PHP scans category folders and generates image cards
- **Selection System**: jQuery manages selected items and quantities
- **Floating Box**: Shows selected items with sticky positioning
- **Booking Form**: Collects user details and sends email requests
- **Category System**: Folder-based organization with collapsible sections

**Data Flow:**
1. PHP scans `/wp-content/uploads/art-department/` for category folders
2. Templates render HTML grid with collapsible categories
3. jQuery handles item selection and quantity changes
4. Form data sent via AJAX to PHP email handler
5. Email notifications sent to customer and admin

#### Current Limitations

**Technical Debt:**
- jQuery dependency limiting modern development practices
- Procedural code structure making maintenance difficult
- No component architecture for UI reuse
- Limited error handling and debugging capabilities

**User Experience Issues:**
- Outdated visual design and interactions
- Poor mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
- No loading states or user feedback
- Limited accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Basic form validation without real-time feedback

**Performance Concerns:**
- No image lazy loading for large galleries
- Synchronous DOM operations causing lag
- No caching for frequently accessed elements
- Unoptimized JavaScript event handling

### 1.2 Business Context and Requirements

#### Business Objectives
- **UI Modernization**: Update visual design to modern standards
- **User Experience**: Improve mobile responsiveness and interactions
- **Performance**: Optimize loading times and user interactions
